# ILN SCF Technical Narrative

This is the umbrella technical narrative for the Invoice Liquidity Network (ILN),
covering the protocol hardening work delivered across all three repositories:

- 🏠 [Invoice-Liquidity-Network](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/Invoice-Liquidity-Network) — SDK, CLI, indexer, notifications, oracle-service, documentation, and CI/CD (this repository)
- ⚙️ [ILN-Smart-Contract](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Smart-Contract) — Soroban smart contracts and WASM artifacts
- 🖥️ [ILN-Frontend](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend) — Next.js web application and dApp

It is the technical-implementation companion to the strategic framing in the
[Trust & Liquidity Model](./trust-liquidity-model.md). Where that document
records the design-phase decisions made in response to reviewer feedback, this
document maps the concrete technical work in all three repos onto each concern
the reviewers raised. It summarises rather than duplicates: each section links
to the authoritative, repository-specific documents.

## How to read this document

Each section below is named after one concern from the reviewer feedback.
For each concern it lists the repositories and components involved, the
technical work delivered, and the primary documents that hold the detail.

## 1. Invoice verification

Invoice verification means establishing that an invoice is real, correctly
formed, and belongs to a legitimate lifecycle — before funds are released.

**Contracts repo:** The invoice lifecycle (`submit`, `fund`, `mark_paid`,
`cancel`, `claim_default`) is enforced on-chain with strict state transitions,
amount and due-date validation, and authorization checks. The lifecycle and
its security controls are documented in the contract threat model's scope and
state-machine sections, and validated by the fuzz suite covering
`submit_invoice` input validation.

**Main repo:** The indexer ingests invoice lifecycle events and re-derives
state from canonical network data, recording ledger/cursor markers and exposing
freshness metadata so consumers can tell final state from stale state. The
oracle service consumes the indexer's history to detect behavioural signals
around invoice creation (see [Default handling](#3-default-handling)). The SDK
validates invoice payload shape and address format before encoding, and
supports offline queuing with tamper-evident re-validation guidance.

**Frontend repo:** The frontend renders invoice data from the indexer and
shows live status, event logs, and settlement state so users can verify the
lifecycle directly rather than trusting a stale view.

## 2. Payer verification

Payer verification answers two distinct questions: is this payer's recent
on-chain behaviour consistent with a legitimate invoice, and is the legal
entity who they claim to be. The two signals are deliberately not equivalent.

**Main repo:** The `oracle-service` computes a trust score from on-chain
settlement history, detects fraud signals (similar-amount bursts, rapid
succession, default clustering, ledger timing anomalies), and returns a
verdict with confidence and an evidence trail. Fraud signals are **blocking**:
a KYB pass cannot clear them. External KYB verification moves confidence but
never overrides a behavioural fraud flag, and a provider that is unavailable
reports `unknown` — never `unverified`, so a provider outage cannot silently
degrade every verdict.

**Contracts repo:** The contract exposes the payer-verification oracle
interface and registry, with governance-controlled oracle registration. The
`fund_invoice` path can require oracle verification before funding.

**Frontend repo:** The frontend surfaces the verification outcome through
`OracleBadge`, rendering the four distinct verdict cases rather than a single
boolean, so users see *why* a payer was or was not verified.

- Frontend: [Security & SRI policy](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/dev/docs/security.md)

## 3. Default handling

Defaults are where LPs can lose principal, so the protocol's default paths
were a central hardening focus.

**Contracts repo:** `claim_default` returns contributed principal to **all**
partial funders in proportion, double-counting of escrowed funds on LP yield
payout was fixed, and `cancel_invoice` refunds partial funders. The insurance
pool contract provides optional default protection with premium collection
and claim UI in the frontend.

**Main repo:** The oracle flags recent concentrated defaults (2+ within the
30-day lookback) as a blocking fraud signal, and the protocol economics model
documents the LP default-risk exposure and the escrow-buffer mechanics.

**Frontend repo:** LP risk preferences gate the marketplace, invoices with
reputation-gated visibility are dimmed for risk-averse LPs, and the insurance
pool opt-in and claim flows give LPs a concrete default-mitigation tool.

- Frontend: [Route Map](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/dev/docs/route-map.md)

## 4. LP risk

LP risk covers the capital exposure LPs take on when funding invoices, and the
mechanisms that let them price and mitigate that exposure.

**Contracts repo:** A fair LP queue uses uniform random selection among tied
reputation scores, preventing front-runner predictability. Reputation scores
drive discount-rate pricing: high-reputation payers clear at lower discount
rates, defaults heavily penalise the payer's score. The distribution contract
and insurance pool expand LP yield and default-protection surface.

**Main repo:** The SDK and oracle provide the risk-relevant inputs — verified
invoices, payer behavioural signals, and reputation snapshots — and the
economics explainer documents the discount-rate pricing model and the three
LP risk classes (default, dispute, expiry/liquidity).

**Frontend repo:** LPs get a marketplace with risk indicator badges, a
watchlist, per-token yield analytics, funding history charts, and insurance
pool opt-in, so risk is visible at the point of decision.

## 5. Target market

The reviewer feedback asked for a defensible target market. The strategic
answer lives in the Trust & Liquidity Model: SME suppliers in emerging markets
(LATAM and Southeast Asia) selling to US-based enterprise buyers.

**Technically**, this choice constrains the protocol in concrete ways that the
three repos' work addresses:

- **Currency risk:** Buyers pay in USD-backed stablecoins (USDC) while
  suppliers can disburse through local-currency anchors. The contract supports
  multi-token invoices (USDC, EURC, XLM) so suppliers and buyers can settle in
  the asset that minimises their exposure.
- **Liquidity cold-start:** A First-Loss Provision absorbs the first 5% of any
  default during the cold-start phase, lowering the risk threshold for
  institutional LP onboarding.
- **KYB at scale:** The pluggable KYB provider adapter (in `oracle-service`)
  integrates regulated identity providers without storing sensitive PII
  natively; the frontend and SDK surface verification state without handling
  identity documents.
- **Localised settlement rails:** Anchor-network members handle the final-mile
  local currency disbursement, which the frontend's multi-token wallet flows
  and settlement UX support.

- Frontend: [Mainnet Launch Notes](https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/ILN-Frontend/blob/dev/docs/mainnet-launch-notes.md)

## 6. Settlement UX

Settlement is the final-mile experience that determines whether a funded
invoice actually pays out on time.

**Frontend repo:** A dedicated payer settlement page with a one-click
settlement flow and approval, a copy-payer-link button, a live due-date
countdown, and partial payment support all reduce the friction between
invoice maturity and `mark_paid`. Transaction toasts and event streaming make
settlement state visible immediately.

**Main repo:** The SDK builds and submits settlement transactions with signer
identity enforcement and simulation-before-signing, the indexer streams
`InvoicePaidEvent` for instant UI updates, and the notifications service
delivers settlement reminders via webhook, email, SMS, and WebSocket with
HMAC-signed payloads.

**Contracts repo:** `mark_paid` releases LP principal plus discount, fees are
deducted at settlement, and the dispute/`appeal_default` path gives payers a
recourse channel when off-chain obligations are contested.

## Cross-cutting hardening

Three workstreams cut across all of the concerns above.

### Security and trust

- **Unified security policy:** The root `SECURITY.md` defines one disclosure,
  severity, response, and safe-harbour policy for all three repos, reconciled
  with the per-repo technical documents. See the [Security Documentation Map](#security-documentation-map) below.
- **SDK trust model:** The SDK is scoped as a thin transaction builder; its
  trust assumptions, validation limits, and key-management guidance are
  documented in [SDK Trust Model](./sdk-trust-model.md).
- **Supply chain:** SLSA Level 3 provenance attestations are published with
  every SDK release, SBOMs ship as release assets, and CI runs gitleaks,
  dependency audits, and Snyk scanning.

### Cross-repo coordination

The three-repo hardening batch followed a formal coordination protocol that
maps domain ownership (contracts, oracle, indexer, notifications, frontend)
and de-duplicates work through the `sync:smart-contract`, `sync:frontend`, and
`sync:all` labels. See [Hardening Batch Coordination](./hardening-batch-coordination.md).

### Release readiness

The mainnet launch checklist tracks every readiness requirement with an owner,
status, and evidence link, and the aggregated `CHANGELOG.md` curates the
mainnet-release story across all three repos. See [Mainnet Launch Checklist](./mainnet-launch-checklist.md).

## Security documentation map

Because this repo alone carries several security-adjacent documents, the
following map records their distinct purposes:

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) | Canonical disclosure policy: supported versions, reporting channels, vulnerability classes, severity, response timelines, safe harbour. Prominently links the SDK Trust Model. |
| [`docs/sdk-trust-model.md`](./sdk-trust-model.md) | **SCF-facing trust narrative for the SDK** — honest boundaries for Freighter signing, RPC trust, oracle/indexer/notifications blast radius. Cross-linked from all three repos' `SECURITY.md` files. |
| [`docs/security-guide.md`](./security-guide.md) | Integrator- and operator-facing security practices: best practices, audit information, provenance verification, incident response. |
| [`docs/security.md`](./security.md) | Navigation stub pointing to `SECURITY.md`, the SDK Trust Model, and the security guide; kept so existing links resolve. |
| [`docs/vulnerability-disclosure.md`](./vulnerability-disclosure.md) | Entryway for reporters: how to report, expected timelines, severity summary, links to the technical threat models. |
| [`docs/threat-model.md`](./threat-model.md) | Protocol-wide attack surface analysis across SDK, frontend, API/indexer, and governance. |

The contract repo's `SECURITY.md`/`docs/security.md` and the frontend repo's
`SECURITY.md`/`docs/security.md` are component-specific implementations of the
same unified policy. Both must surface a prominent link to
[`docs/sdk-trust-model.md`](./sdk-trust-model.md) in this repository (absolute URL:
`https://github.com/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/Invoice-Liquidity-Network/blob/dev/docs/sdk-trust-model.md`).
Suggested sibling-repo snippets live in
[`docs/sdk-trust-model-cross-repo.md`](./sdk-trust-model-cross-repo.md).
